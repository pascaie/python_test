Python package installation

1st way) using "pip"
  open the cmd and run the following command:

  >pip install <package_name>
  example: >pip install numpy

2nd way) If you cannot run the pip command directly (possibly because the location where
          it was installed isn’t on your operating system’s PATH) then you can run pip via
          the Python interpreter:

  >python -m pip <pip arguments>
  example: >python -m pip install numpy
