***pyInstaller: convert Python script (.py) into Windows executable (.exe)

Instructions:

1) install pyInstaller package. Open the cmd and run:

  pip install pyinstaller

2) go to the directory where resides the Python script you want to convert (use "cd <path>")
  On the cmd, run:

  pyinstaller -F yourprogram.py

  some directory is then generated. You can find the executable file under the "dist" directory
  NOTE: the "-F" options allows you to create one single .exe file under the "dist" directory (otherwise, multiple files would be generated)
  NOTE: you can move the file outside the "dist" directory and it will work
  NOTE: when running the executable, the output window is automatically closed as soon as the Python script ends its tasks.
        To keep the window open, insert "input("Press Enter to continue...") at the end of your Python script
